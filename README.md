"# Practice" 

RPD: 
Implements the code for Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm

Python: 
The codes have been cloned from a github repository and further modified

ANKPAL: 
This code is for the solution for a CodeChef problem(ANKPAL). Unfortunately could not beat time restriction. Also the code is as good as if it is written in C

TREE:
Currently contains BST implementation

AES:
Under development. Implementation of the AES encryption algorithm.

TR1: 
Codechef problem TR1. Unfortunately could not beat time restriction.

CHEFDETE:
Codechef problem CHEFDETE. Successful submission. Beginner level.(Used to boost morale).

New Year Chaos:
Hacker rank problem with the same name has met the same fate as TR1 and ANKPAL. Could not beat time for test case 6 and 8. On the other hand this code is proof that getchar_unlocked is faster than any other method to get input data as this allowed me to pass two test cases.

AnD: Another Hacker Rank problem named Append and Delete.
