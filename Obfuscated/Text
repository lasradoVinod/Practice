Dear Friends

Sometimes life puts you in situations where one has to let go of things dearer to you in pursuit of something better. Few days ago I was in a similar situation and I had to make a hard decision to take a leave from all of you and take up new challenges and start a new phase in my career.

I want to thank my fellow team members and managers from the bottom of my heart for your constant support and guidance throughout. I will miss you all.

Thank you for being a part of my journey here at KPIT.~
